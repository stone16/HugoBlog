# Confirmation Bias
## definition
When we have a decision in advance, we'll try to find all examples matching this decision, but ignore all dis-confirming objects, that's build in stuff in our nature

## solutions
To overcome it, we should not bring some theory in advance and try to find supportive data. Instead, start from all data first, accumulate them and see its relation, then build our theory based on all valid examples.

+ talk to different people, try to understand more from other perspective
+ listen carefully about what others what to present

Quite similar to First Principle, we have a claim, then we try to seek all supportive marterials and unconciously ignore others. What we actutally need to do is follow First Principle , find the fundamentals, and start from there is check what we have
